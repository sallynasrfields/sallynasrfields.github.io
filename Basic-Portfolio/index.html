								Currently working as a Planning focused SAP developer, IT and Business Analyst at a divestiture of Hewlett Packard, and seeking to strenthen my skills as a developer to help achieve my goal of obtainiing a job that allows me to work remotely. In 2010 I obtained a Bachelors of Business Administration in Management Information Systems and shortly afterwards was hired onto Hewlett Packard, where I've remained until now. During this time I've gained lots of analytical and technical skills, learning about many complex business processes and delivering several cross-system solutions in the Planning space as a team member and contributor on several different projects.</br></br>

								With six years of experience working for Hewlett-Packard, I am excited to say that I am ready to move on and try something new, whether it be a shift in industry, or in a completely different technical field outside of SAP. This vast world of information technology is constantly evolving and I'd like to evolve with it, getting exposed to new technologies and challenges, working to makes all of our lives better, solving problems, both locally and world-wide.
